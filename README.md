# Hami MiniMarket - Fresh Local Produce Catalog



## Project Purpose

This project is a dynamic, responsive product catalog page for Hami MiniMarket, a local shop specializing in fresh fruits and vegetables. It builds upon an existing landing page by adding interactive e-commerce features.

This project was completed as part of the HamiSkills Web Development Internship (Week 2 Task).

## Features Implemented

- **Dynamic Product Catalog:** Products are now loaded dynamically from a JavaScript array, making the catalog manageable and scalable.
 
- **Real-time Search:** A search bar allows users to filter products by name instantly as they type.
 
- **Category Filter:** Users can filter products by category ("All", "Fruits", "Vegetables") using interactive buttons.
 
- **Price Filter:** A sleek range slider allows users to filter products by a maximum price.
 
- **Responsive Design:** The entire page, including the new filter bar and product grid, is fully responsive and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
 
- **"Add to Cart" Functionality (Bonus)**: Each product card features an "Add to Cart" button.
 
- **Cart Counter (Bonus):** A cart icon in the navigation bar updates with a counter each time a product is added.
 
- **Brand Consistency:** All new elements are styled to perfectly match the existing brand identity, using the established CSS color palette and typography.
 
- **Smooth Animations:** New product cards fade and slide in on scroll, and buttons feature clean hover effects, consistent with the original site's feel.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3** - Responsive design, animations, and styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - DOM manipulation, event handling, real-time filtering logic, and cart functionality
